# Sovol SV06 Plus firmware

This is a customized version of
[Sovol's Marlin firmware for the SV06 Plus 3D printer][sovol-sv06-plus-repo].

## Fork information

This fork has been updated to a later version of Marlin versus the version that ships with
the Sovol3D SV06 Plus.

The intent is to get it to 2.1.2+ so that I can get ZV input shaping.  So far, it has been
updated from 2.0.9.2 to 2.0.9.4.  This is the version from which the main '2.1.x' Marlin
upstream branch is forked, so next release will be with Marlin 2.1 merged.

### Fork History

This is version V1.1.5-3smk-2sv, corresponding to 2.0.9.4.

Version v1.1.5-3smk-1sv, corresponds to 2.0.9.3.  In this version, I just tested that the
full Z leveling + 25â€“point auto leveling worked.  I also printed one item that seemed to
work.


## Fork/Branch Disclaimer

This firmware is experimental. Using any third party or custom software carries risks,
including damage to your printer.  If you use this firmware, you accept responsibility for
any undesired behavior or damage this firmware may cause. If you are not comfortable with
these risks, do not use this firmware.

# New features

* On bed leveling ([`G29`][G29]) completion, return the LCD to the leveling
  screen. Originally the LCD would get stuck displaying the final leveling grid
  with no option to exit if `G29` were invoked via serial.

* Using [`M73`][M73], display progress and remaining time on the LCD just like
  when printing from the SD card. The LCD's print cancel button now works to
  stop the print, so long as the client supports the cancel host action (which
  [Octoprint][octoprint] does). This is adapted from
  [the LCD branch of daleye's fork][daleye-fork-lcd-branch].

# Branch information

This `main` branch is Sovol's Marlin changes for the SV06 Plus merged
into upstream Marlin, with additional custom functionality.

The [`main-upstream`][branch-main-upstream] branch is similar but without new
additional features.

# Repository structure

Sovol's firmware for the SV06 Plus is based on [Marlin 2.0.9.2][marlin-2.0.9.2].
It is published within the `MarlinSV06Plus` directory within their
[SV06 Plus repository][sovol-sv06-plus-repo].

This repository merges the [official Marlin repository][marlin-repo] with
Sovol's changes, with additional features on top.

Two additional branches are available to identify Sovol's changes from Marlin
2.0.9.2:

* [`sovol-marlin-merged`][branch-sovol-marlin-merged]: A simple merge of Marlin
  2.0.9.2 and Sovol's firmware source code, preserving all changes
* [`sovol-marlin-merged-minimal`][branch-sovol-marlin-merged-minimal]: A reduced
  merge of Marlin 2.0.9.2 and Sovol's firmware source code, removing
  non-functional changes and whitespace errors to produce a minimal set of
  functional changes.

Some upstream Marlin paths have been renamed to avoid collisions:

* Upstream `.github/` is [`.github_marlin/`](/.github_marlin/)
* Upstream `README.md` is [`README.marlin.md`](/README.marlin.md)

# Building the firmware

The firmware ([Marlin][marlin]) is built with a tool called
[platformio][platformio], which is a Python package. Install this tool with pip
(or similar tool such as [pipx][pipx]):

```console
pip install platformio
```

Build the firmware:

```console
platformio run -e STM32F103RET6_sovol_maple
```

The built firmware is in `.pio/build/STM32F103RET6_sovol_maple/`
named using the format `firmware-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.bin`.

# Installing the firmware

The firmware is updated using a microSD card.

[Sovol has an official firmware update video.][sovol-sv06-plus-firmware-update-video]
While the video says the microSD card must be formatted as FAT32 with a 4KiB
(4096 byte) block size, I could not get the firmware to update on my printer
with my microSD card formatted this way. However, using my microSD cards'
default formatting of FAT32 with a 512 block size worked fine, so long as the
card was 16GiB or less.

Update steps:

* Remove all other files and folders from the microSD card.
* Copy the built firmware `.bin` file to your microSD card.
  * **Important note:** The printer's mainboard remembers the file name from the
    previous firmware update, so ensure the new firmware file is named
    differently from the previous update (e.g. use `fw2.bin` if `fw1.bin` was
    used last time). The board only seems to remember the single previous
    filename. Also note that for this comparison, the board may be using only
    the first 6-8 characters of the file name (e.g. ancient MS-DOS filename
    shortening, `long_file_name.bin` -> `long_f~1.bin`).
* Unmount / eject / safely remove the microSD card from your computer.
* Turn off your printer.
* Insert the microSD card into your printer's microSD card slot.
* Turn on your printer.

The SV06 Plus LCD will show the Sovol logo, which will appear to freeze for
several seconds. When the firmware update is complete, the LCD animation of the
extruder printing Sovol's logo will continue as normal. If the LCD remains
frozen for more than 30 seconds or so, the firmware update process has failed.

# Firmware restoration / recovery

If the firmware update process fails, the board will need to be re-flashed with
a working firmware such as Sovol's official SV06 Plus firmware. The process is
the same as above, but using Sovol's official firmware image file.

[Sovol publishes firmware updates here][sovol-download-page]. Their SV06 Plus
firmware link points to [this Google Drive folder][sovol-sv06-plus-gdrive]. As a
last resort,
[I am including a copy of Sovol's official SV06 Plus firmware (version 1.1.5) in this repository as `.static/SV06 Plus_V1.1.5_0324.bin`][local-firmware-copy].
